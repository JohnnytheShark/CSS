# Chapter 7 Harnessing Full Power of Float

Float is purpose-built to allow other content to wrap around the element being floated; as a result, it shines at manipulating images inside text and creating drop caps

## Drop Caps
Drop Caps are a way to style and add emphasis to text. They consist of creating a larger captial letter, usually at the beginning of a page or paragraph. Drop caps are much rarer on web, but they're by no means impossible to create, and they're a great way to make our online typography interesting.


## Leading 
Leading is the amount of space between lines. Line Height between 1.5 and 2 makes line tracking easier for people with cognitive disabilities.

## Justification
Justifying the text means we're going to make all our lines the same width.

## Importing Fonts
Remember to do so at the top of your CSS file

## Wrap Cirlces
To wrap circles we can use circle(<shape-radius>, at <position>)
The aspect ratio of an image is the proportional relationship of the image's height and width calculated by dividing the width by the height.

To make the image truly appear clipped we use clip-path

### Using Border radius
We can clip the image itself into a circle using border-radius: 50%; 

## Images Wraps: 
We can give an image an aspect ratio, 
float it
link to the actual svg path image to give it a shape outside using shape-outside
shape-margin to give it some margin
then an overall margin with margin-right
