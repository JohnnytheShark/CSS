# Designing a Checkout Cart

## Screen Sizes
Start with a plan of 3 different screen sizes
Narrow (Phones)
Medium (Tablets)
Wide (Desktop Computers and High-Resolution Tablets)

## Button Styles

When preparing your checkout you are going to want your actions to be color coded in separate themes. Red button to remove items, green to submit or proceed, or an off focus color to be able to return to shopping

## Table Styles
It's beneficial to display your cart items in a table as this organizes your items

## Card Styles 
After implementing styles to a table it might be beneficial to separate items into cards. 

Adding a box shadow can accomplish the look you are after.

From there adjustments may be needed such as making buttons display as inline-blocks;

After themes are established, we can focus on making layout choices.
